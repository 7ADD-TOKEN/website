                            We propose the HOLDTOWIN (7ADD) Erc20 token : A chance to get a part of traders fees through luck and strategy.<br>
                            <br>
                            <h3 class="h2">Introduction</h3><br>
                            The HOLDTOWIN (7ADD) is a standard ERC20 token which is originally minted in full supply. The minting was made at block<br>
                            11268495 on the Ethereum Network.The INITIAL total supply is 100.000 7ADD. No more minting of 7ADD is possible.<br>
                            The token contract address is : 0xEd36482c7F8E5850e91aC0Cf6BF2130A1aA2DF92<br>
                            <br>
                            <h3 class="h2">Overview</h3><br>
                            In this paper we will introduce the idea o a game based on a deflationary supply (7ADD).<br>
                            A smart contract has been deployed on the Ethereum Network.All the code is public and anyone can check by a trustless<br>
                            method all the details of the ERC20 token 7ADD. The smart contract is the only one holding tokens and by buying 7ADD you<br>
                            are included in a list of HOLDERS. Anyone can check the list of HOLDERS at a given time. The smart contract gives the<br>
                            right for addresses to spend 7ADD.<br>
                            <br>
                            <h3 class="h2">Description</h3><br>
                            The primary condition for a game to take place is that it should exist on a network with enough potential participants.
                            (Existence of Game in a Network).<br>
                            The second condition of a game to take place is to have players. Only after players announce their wish to play, the
                            game can begin. (Players).<br>
                            <br>
                            The third condition for a game to begin is that players must have the ressources required by it. (Primary Resources).<br>
                            The fourth condition for a game to begin is to have specific rules stated to all players BEFORE the game begins (Rules
                            of the Game).<br>
                            <br>
                            <h3 class="h4">Existence of Game in a Network</h3><br>
                            The HOLDTOWIN Game is designed as a smart contract on the Ethereum Network.<br>
                            <h3 class="h4">Players</h3><br>
                            All the participants on the Ethereum Network can be players in HOLDTOWIN.<br>
                            <h3 class="h4">Primary Resources</h3><br>
                            The primary resource needed for players to be able to play the HOLDTOWIN game is the Erc20 token 7ADD.<br>
                            <br>
                            Properties of token:<br>
                            Symbol : 7ADD<br>

                            Total supply : 100000<br>
                            Decimals : 18<br>
                            Initial Circulating Supply :100000<br>
                            Type: Deflationary<br>
                            <br>
                            There is a 1.25% burn of 7ADD erc20 token on any transaction.<br>
                            There is a 1.25% fee of 7ADD erc20 token from any transaction that will be added to the Jackpot.<br>
                            Total fee when you buy 7ADD erc20 token = 2.5% * 1.25% burn and 1.25% to jackpot *<br>
                            Total fee when you sell 7ADD erc20 token = 2.5% * 1.25% burn and 1.25% to jackpot *<br>
                            <br>
                            Total fee when you transfer 7ADD erc20 token to any other address = 2.5% * 1.25% burn and 1.25% to jackpot *<br>
                            Rules of the Game<br>
                            <br>
                            The HOLDTOWIN game contains rules that are immutable (imprinted on the smart contract)<br>
                            and rules that can be changed by consensus of the players through GOVERNANCE.<br>
                            <br>
                            1.Resources needed (immutable rule)<br>
                            For participation into the game a player must hold a number of 7ADD at a specific time.<br>
                            <br>
                            2.Number of resources needed (mutable rule)<br>
                            For participation into jackpot drawings a player must hold 5(five) 7ADD tokens at a specific time.
                            Holding 5 (five) 7ADD tokens will grant any player a chance to be drawn as winner.
                            *A player can hold a multiple of 5 tokens for more chances to be drawn as a winner (WEIGHT of Holder).
                            *A players’ amount of tokens that is nondivisible by 5 will be rounded to the nearest to 0 decimal value.
                            EX: A player with 16 tokens will have a WEIGHT of 3 (16:5=3.2).
                            A player with 14 tokens will have a WEIGHT of 3. (14:5=2.8)
                            For participation into GOVERNANCE a user must hold ANY amount of 7ADD tokens.<br>
                            <br>
                            3.Jackpot Drawings (mutable rule)<br>
                            A drawing of 3 winners will take place every day at 11:00 GMT.
                            Snapshot of holders will be taken at 10:00 GMT every day.
                            Jackpot and participants are capped at 10:00 GMT.
                            Drawing will be made using randompicker.com Proxy Random Provider. (subject to change in further development of the project)<br>
                            <br>
                            4.Winners of the game (mutable rule)<br>
                            There will be 3 winners each day.<br>
                            Winner 1 - 60% of the Jackpot<br>
                            Winner 2 - 30% of the jackpot<br>
                            Winner 3 – 10% of the jackpot<br>
                            <br>
                            5.Jackpot (immutable rule)<br>
                            The jackpot is made out of 1.25% from ANY transaction of 7ADD.<br>
                            <br>
                            6.Jackpot accumulation (mutable rule) 24 hour period<br>
                            <br>
                            7.Burning supply (immutable rule)<br>
                            The burning is made out of 1.25% from ANY transaction of 7ADD.<br>
                            Obtaining Resources<br>

                            Obtaining resources in HOLDTOWIN game can be made through various methods. The initial distribution of resources is made
                            in several STEPS.<br>
                            <br>
                            <h3 class="h3">STEP 1</h3><br>
                            A PRESALE of 48750 (50% minus burns and jackpot contribution from transfer ) 7ADD tokens will take place at a price of
                            0.011 ETH/ 1 (one) 7ADD.<br>
                            Initial price 1 USD = 1 (one) 7ADD (1 ETH = 460 USD)<br>
                            <br>
                            <h3 class="h3">STEP 2</h3><br>
                            All ETH gathered in the PRESALE will be put as collateral for 39000 (40% minus burns and jackpot contribution from
                            transfer) 7ADD. The PRESALE can be considered as a Liquidity Generation Event with an increased price.<br>
                            * If all 48750 7ADD will be sold into PRESALE at 1 USD/ 1 7ADD, the price of 1 7ADD on UNISWAP will be 1.25 USD / 1 7ADD when providing liquidity. (1 ETH = 460 USD)
                            Liquidity will be locked via Unicrypt and the transaction Hash will be available on the official website of HOLDTOWIN game.
                            Presale will last 20 DAYS.<br>
                            <br>
                            <h3 class="h3">STEP 3</h3><br>
                            After 24 hours from the liquidity supply we will make the first jackpot draw using the above rules.
                            If all condition are fullfiled (full sale and full liquidity provided), the initial Jackpot will be 1250 7ADD ( 1562.5 USD at price of Uniswap when listing.) (1 ETH = 460 USD)<br>
                            <br>
                            EXCEPTIONS:<br>
                            1. If in the PRESALE not all the 7ADD tokens are sold (50%) , we will take a snapshot of the presale holders, redeploy<br>
                            contract with modified Total Supply with same proportions:<br>
                            50% - PRESALE HOLDERS<br>
                            40% - LIQUIDITY TOKENS<br>
                            5% - TEAM TOKENS<br>
                            5%- MARKETING TOKENS<br>
                            1.25% from all funds will be the first Jackpot as all new tokens will be airdropped<br>
                            1.25% from all funds will be burned burned as all tokens will be transferred<br>
                            STEP 4<br>
                            As for initiating the BOUNCE presale a transfer is required, a burn of 625 Tokens and a Jackpot contribution of 625<br>
                            tokens will take place. That will be added to the SECOND jackpot of the game on day 2.<br>
                            <br>
                            The game will continue from STEP 4 as it is voted by the GOVERNANCE.<br>

                            The Governance will start after the 2 jackpots are given to lucky users. (after 48 hours from Liquidity Providing Event)<br>
                            Governance will take place on the snapshot.page platform.<br>
                            Any holder of above 5(five) 7ADD tokens can propose rule changes and the other holders will vote. The rules will be<br>
                            changed based on vote majority. Over 50% of the total amount of circulating coins must vote for proposal to be admitted.<br>
                            (Uniswap liquidity is not included into the circulating coins)<br>
                            The Deployer of this contract can propose official rule changes on the CORE proposal tab of snapshot.page dedicated<br>
